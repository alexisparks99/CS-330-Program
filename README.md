How do I approach designing software?
  When it comes to designing software, I view it as eating a sandwich, taking it one bite at a time. When it comes to designing software, I take it one step at a time. When it comes to a bigger project, it is important to work in small sections, especially when it comes to the coding aspect. During this course, I have learned that whether it is a 3D scene or a piece of software, you have to look at it from all angles. 

How do I approach developing programs?
  When it comes to a project's development, iterations and persistence play a big role. I have had very little experience with OpenGL before starting this course, and I still have so much more to learn. OpenGL is a lot of trial and error. Each milestone in this course helped me better understand how the coding process worked, and it wasn't too much at one time. As mentioned above, it is important to work in small sections because if you work in larger sections, it can become overwhelming and too much to handle at one time. 

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
  Comp Graphics and Visualization has been an experience like no other. I feel like I have gotten better at coding and understanding what it has to offer. Each milestone in this course helped me better understand what was expected, and I was able to visually see the progress changing every single week. Since working on different tasks with each milestone, I was able to understand what was being asked and work on the sepecific task that was being asked, instead of trying to tackle the whole project at once.
